This small project is a collection of models and calculations that were created in Python in order to assist with multi-series tutorial on the Binomial Option Pricing Model and its convergence to the Black Scholes Merton Model.

As the binomial option model time steps increase in number such that they become arbitrarily small, the Binomial model decison tree conververges to a contant time model that is the basis for the Black Scholes Merton Model.

More thourough descriptions and detailed analysis are found in the blog posts included in the links below.
